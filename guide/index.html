                <div class="guide-card">
                    <p>Mafia is a social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles. The
                        <strong>Town</strong> and <strong>Mafia</strong> factions aim to eliminate each other, while
                        <strong>Neutral</strong> players have their own win conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Town start out in the
                        majority, and can use their numbers to their advantage, voting out suspected Mafia members
                        during the daytime. Meanwhile, the Mafia start out in the minority, but their abilities are
                        powerful and they may work together in secret.
                    </p>
                    <p>The game alternates between <strong>Day</strong> and <strong>Night</strong> phases.</p>
